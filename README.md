Picotron Stargazer
==================

A 2D sandbox game for the Picotron fantasy console!

Check it out at:

- [Cardboard Box Server (unsandboxed, faster)](https://cardboardbox.tech/stargazer/)

Currently, this repository only includes the .p64 file, as a VCS-based development pipeline is not very easy to pull off with Picotron.

The .p64 file can be browsed with any text editor to reveal the Lua source code, sans the larger files which are compressed and encoded with base64.
